# <ins>CSS Flexbox Practice</ins>

### Introduction
So far I have worked with the CSS Box Model which has been not as hard to understand. It's after trying to work on a different project on a recipe website that I discovered the Box model cannot really help me move some things around.

With Flexbox I am able to group items together in HTML using say a ```<div></div>``` with a class inside and the move the items together.
